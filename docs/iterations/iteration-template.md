## 🎯 Goal
Describe the goal of this iteration in 1-2 sentences.  
E.g., "Track and display temperature data from a single Raspberry Pi sensor in the Django Admin interface."

---

## 🔨 Features to Implement
List of key features or changes planned in this iteration:
- [ ] Setup Django models for sensor data
- [ ] Raspberry Pi script to send temperature data
- [ ] REST API endpoint to receive sensor data
- [ ] Display sensor readings in Django Admin

---

## 📐 Architecture / Design
(Optional) Sketch out or describe the architectural changes here. You can include:
- Module interactions
- Temporal.io workflows (if relevant)
- API contracts

---

## 🧪 Experiments / Spikes
Document quick tests or research:
- Evaluate integration of Temporal.io with Django
- Try streaming vs polling for sensor updates

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track
What KPIs or data should you collect?
- Sensor ping latency
- Number of sensor entries in DB per day
- Uptime of sensor scripts

---

## ✅ Done When
- Sensor data is visible in the Django Admin
- Data is being received at least every 5 minutes
- Code is committed, tested, and deployed to dev environment

---
